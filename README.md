# ISLR_Chapter_5
Code and work for "Applied" problems at the end of Introduction to Statistical Learning Chapter 4, completed in R and in Python.

For the R work, I have made the effort to not consult existing attempts to complete these excercises so that the work is my own.

For the Python work, I am indebted to JWarmenhoven's work to replicate the lessons and labs in ISLR in Python (though I have often deviated from it and done things my own way). This can be found at https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/ISLR-python
